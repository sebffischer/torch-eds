**Tutorial and Exercise**

Most of the exercises are similar to the examples from the tutorial.

**AI Autocompletion**

If you have AI autocompletion, we recommend disabling it, as GPT-4 already knows the `torch` API.

**Hints**

Hints give additional information that can help you solve the exercise.
Don't hesitate to open them when you are stuck.

**CPU vs. CUDA**

All exercises can be solved with a CPU only.

**Uncertainty**

To make the exercises run fast, we are often using datasets with few observations and resamplings without too many iterations.
This means that there is often uncertainty in the results that we mostly ignore, but which would have to be taken account in a proper analysis.
