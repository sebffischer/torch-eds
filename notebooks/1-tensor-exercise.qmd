To solve these exercises, consulting the `torch` [function reference](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/reference/) can be helpful.
:::

**Question 1**: Tensor creation and manipulation

Recreate this torch tensor:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(torch)
x <- torch_tensor(matrix(1:6, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 2))
x
```

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
First create an R `matrix` and then convert it using `torch_tensor()`.
</details>

Next, create a view of the tensor so it looks like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x$view(c(3, 2))
```

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Use the `$view()` method and pass the desired shape as a vector.
</details>

How can you check programmatically that you successfully created a view, and not a copy (i.e. changing one does change the other)?

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
See what happens when you modify one of the tensors.
</details>

::: {.content-visible when-meta=solutions}
**Solution**

We start by creating the tensor:

```{r}
x <- torch_tensor(matrix(1:6, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 2))
x
```

Then, we create a view of the tensor:

```{r}
y <- x$view(c(3, 2))
```

To check that we created a view, we can modify one of the tensors and see if the other one changes:

```{r}
x[1, 1] <- 100
y
```
:::

**Question 2**: More complex reshaping

Consider the following tensor:

```{r}
x <- torch_tensor(1:6)
x
```


Reshape it so it looks like this.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x$reshape(c(3, 2))$permute(c(2, 1))
```

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
First reshape to `(2, 3)` and then `$permute()` the two dimensions.
</details>

::: {.content-visible when-meta=solutions}
**Solution**
When reshaping, we start by filling up rows, then columns (and then higher dimensions).
We therefore first reshape to `(3, 2)` and then permute the two dimensions to get the desired shape `(2, 3)`.

```{r}
x <- x$reshape(c(3, 2))
x
x$permute(c(2, 1))
```
:::

**Question 3**: Broadcasting

Consider the following vectors:

```{r}
x1 <- torch_tensor(c(1, 2))
x1
x2 <- torch_tensor(c(3, 7))
x2
```

Predict the result (shape and values) of the following operation by applying the broadcasting rules.

```{r, output = FALSE}
x1 + x2$reshape(c(2, 1))
```

::: {.content-visible when-meta=solutions}
**Solution**

The result is the following tensor:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
x1 + x2$reshape(c(2, 1))
```

We will now show how to arrive at this step by step.
According to the broadcasting rules, we start by adding a singleton dimension to the first tensor:

```{r}
x1 <- x1$reshape(c(1, 2))
```

Now, we have a tensor of shape `(1, 2)` and a tensor of shape `(2, 1)`.
Next, we extend the first tensor along the first dimension to match the second tensor:

```{r}
x1 <- x1$expand(c(2, 2))
```

We do this analogously for the second (reshaped) tensor:

```{r}
x2 <- x2$reshape(c(2, 1))$expand(c(2, 2))
```

```{r}
x1 + x2
```

**Question 4**: Handling Singleton dimensions

A common operation in deep learning is to add or get rid of singleton dimensions, i.e., dimensions of size 1.
As this is so common, torch offers a [`$squeeze()`](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/reference/torch_squeeze.html) and [`$unsqueeze()`](https://torch.mlverse.org/docs/reference/torch_squeeze.html) method to add and remove singleton dimensions.

Use these two functions to first remove the second dimension and then add one in the first position.

```{r}
x <- torch_randn(2, 1)
x
```

::: {.content-visible when-meta=solutions}
**Solution**
```{r}
x$squeeze(2)$unsqueeze(1)
```
:::

**Question 5**: Matrix multiplication

Generate a random matrix $A$ of shape `(10, 5)` and a random matrix $B$ of shape `(10, 5)` by sampling from a standard normal distribution.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Use `torch_randn(nrow, ncol)` to generate random matrices.
</details>

Can you multiply these two matrices with each other and if so, in which order?
If not, generate two random matrices with compatible shapes and multiply them.

::: {.content-visible when-meta=solutions}
**Solution**

We can only multiply a matrix of shape `(n, k)` with a matrix of shape `(k, m)` if the number of columns in the first matrix matches the number of rows in the second matrix.

We can therefore not multiply the two matrices with each other in either order.
To generate two random matrices with compatible shapes, we can generate two random matrices with shape `(10, 5)` and `(5, 10)`.

```{r}
A <- torch_randn(10, 5)
B <- torch_randn(5, 10)
A$matmul(B)
```
:::

**Question 6**: Uniform sampling

Generate 10 random variables from a uniform distribution (using only torch functions) in the interval $[10, 20]$.
Use `torch_rand()` for this (which does not allow for `min` and `max` parameters).

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
Add the lower bound and multiply with the width of the interval.
</details>

::: {.content-visible when-meta=solutions}
**Solution**
Because the uniform distribution of `torch` has no `min` and `max` parameters like `runif()`, we instead sample from a standard uniform distribution and then scale and shift it to the desired interval.

Then, calculate the mean of the values that are larger than 15.
```{r}
n <- 10
a <- 10
b <- 20
x <- torch_rand(n) * (b - a) + a
```

```{r}
mean(x[x > 15])
```

:::

**Question 7**: Don't touch this

Consider the code below:

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  x[1] <- torch_tensor(-99)
  return(x)
}
x <- torch_tensor(1:3)
y <- f(x)
x
```

Implement a new different version of this function that returns the same tensor but does not change the value of the input tensor in-place.

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>
The `$clone()` method might be helpful.
</details>

::: {.content-visible when-meta=solutions}
**Solution**

We need to `$clone()` the tensor before we modify it.

```{r}
g <- function(x) {
  x <- x$clone()
  x[1] <- torch_tensor(-99)
  x
}
x <- torch_tensor(1:3)
y <- g(x)
x
```
